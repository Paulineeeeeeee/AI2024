These colors are also known as primary colors, which are the first colors that can be seen in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe colors in a rainbow are created when light from a source such as the sun or a light source is reflected off of objects in the sky. The light is then refracted and bounced off of other objects in the sky, creating a rainbow.

If an automobile rounds this curve at 30 m/s, what is the minimum coefficient of static friction needed between tires and road to prevent skidding?\n\n### Response:\nTo determine the minimum coefficient of static friction needed between tires and road to prevent skidding, we need to calculate the coefficient of static friction between the tires and the road. The coefficient of static friction is a measure of how much force is required to cause a change in the motion of a system. The coefficient of static friction between tires and road is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of friction between tires and road by the force of friction.\n\nThe coefficient of static friction between tires and road is calculated by multiplying the coefficient of friction between tires and road by the force of friction.\n\nThe coefficient of friction between tires and road is 0.6, which is the coefficient of friction between a tire and a smooth surface.\n\nThe force of friction between tires and road is 100 N, which is the force of friction between a tire and a smooth surface.\n\nThe coefficient of static friction between tires and road is 0.6 * 100 = 60 N.\n\nThe minimum coefficient of static friction needed between tires and road to prevent skidding is 60 N."
